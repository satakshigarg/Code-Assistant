# Text-based Code Assistant

This is a simple Python script that serves as a text-based code assistant. It utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically OpenAI's GPT-3, to assist users with writing Python code by providing code suggestions and explanations.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text_code_assistant.git
   cd text_code_assistant

2. **Set up your OpenAI API key:**

Open assistant.py and set your OpenAI API key:

```python
# Set your OpenAI API key here
openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'
```

3. **Run the code assistant:**

```python
python assistant.py
```

4. **Enter Python code:**
Enter your Python code when prompted, and the code assistant will provide suggestions and explanations.

## How the Code Assistant Works

The code assistant uses OpenAI's GPT-3 to assist users with writing Python code. When you enter a code snippet, the assistant sends a prompt to GPT-3, asking for suggestions. GPT-3 generates text completions that can include code suggestions, explanations, or additional context related to the input code.

To use the code assistant, set your OpenAI API key in the `assistant.py` file. Ensure you comply with OpenAI's usage policies.
